# SpaceVagrant

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.25
  
The first thing you will need to view this open source project is unreal engine v 4.25 which can be acquired here:  
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/get-now/agnostic  
(this is a launcher for unreal where you can then select and install the required version)  

To compile this project for the UE4 editor, you will need MS Visual Studio 2017 (it can be the free community version) with the following packages:
* Desktop Development with C++
* Game Development with C++
* .NET Desktop Development

Once you have the correct environment for MSVS 2017 and UE4.25 annotated above, you can open the spacevagrant.uproject, a prompt about missing modules will occur and select yes to rebuild them now.  After the rebuild finishes the editor will open allowing you access to the blueprints and code throught the UE4 editor.
